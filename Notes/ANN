Why Deep Learning Now
- Large Amount of Data
- Computing Power
- Algorithms

Types of NN
- Perceptron: simplest and oldest model of neuron
- Feed forward: primariyly used for supervised machine learning, All nodes are fully connected, used where data is neither sequenctial nor time dependent

Python Libraries
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Theano
- Pytorch
