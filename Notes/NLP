NLP - Natural Language Processing

NLP is a broad field, encompassing a variety of tasks, including:
Part-of-speech tagging: identify if each word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
Named entity recognition NER): identify person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, etc)
Text Classification
Question answering
Speech recognition
Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text
Topic modeling
Semantics and Sentiment classification
Language modeling
Translation
Text Generation

- Tokenization (Word Tokenizer/ Sentence Tokenizer)
- POS (Parts of speech tagging) and chunking
- NER (Named Entity Recogntition)
- Stemming
- Lemmatization
- Stop Words, punctuations
- Bag of Words
- N-gram
- skip grams
- TF=IDF


Examples of Sequences
- Time Series Data (Sales)
- Sentences
- Audio
- Car Trajectories
- Music

NLP problems can be solved using both
 - Machine Learning
 - Deep Learning


Types of Deep Learning
==========================
Supervised Deep Learning
 - ANN used for Regression and Classification
 - CNN used for Computer Vision
 - RNN used for Time Series Analysis
Usupervised Deep Learning
 - Self Organizing Maps used for Feature Detection
 - Deep Boltzmann Machines used for Recommnder Systems
 - Auto Encoders used for Recommnder Systems

Neural Networks and Human Brain
================================
Whole concept behind deep learning is to try to mimic the human brain and leverage the things that evolution has already developed for us.

Human Brain got 3 parts
- Cerebrum
    - Temporal Lobe (Long Term Memory) linked to ANN, Weights represent Long-term memory
    - Frontal Lobe - linked RNN for short term memory
    - Ocipital Lobe - linked to CNN
    - Parietal Lobe - Research going on for linking NN
- Cerebellum
- Brainstem

Why Not Feedforward Networks
=============================
- I cannot predict the next word in a sentence if I use it


Types of RNN
=============
One to One(Vec2Vec) -
One to Many(Vec2Seq) - Music Generation, Image Captioning, Text Generation for e.g. saying hello
Many to One(Seq2Vec) - Sentiment Analysis/Classification, Gender Recognition from speech
Many to Many(Seq2Seq) - (Input and Output are not same) Machine Translation
Many to Many(Seq2Seq) - (Input and Output are same) Named Entity Recognition


Applications
- speech recognition,
- language modeling,
- translation,
- image captioning

RNN
Use cases of RNN
- NLP
- Machine Translation, Machine writing novels
- Speech Recognition
- Image Description Generation
- Text Similarity Calculation
- New application areas such as music recommendation, youtube recommendation, etc.



People Behind Recurrent Neural Networks
========================================
Sepp (Joseph) Hochreiter - vanishing gradient was first discovered in 1991
Yoshua Bengio - vanishing gradient was again discovered in 1994


An issue with RNN is that after a while network will begin to forget the first inputs as information is lost
at each step going through the RNN. We need some sort of long memory for our networks

Backpropagation through Time (BTT)
===================================
RNN uses back propagation algorithm , but it is applied for every timestamp. It is called BTT
Problems with it are:
- Vanishing Gradient Problem
- Exploding Gradient Problem

Solutions to the Problems
=============================================
In case of exploding gradient, you can:
- stop backpropagating after a certain point, which is usually not optimal because not all of the weights get updated; truncated BTT
- penalize or artificially reduce gradient;
- put a maximum limit on a gradient, and clip the gradients when it goes higher then threshold
- RMSprop to adjust learning rate

In case of vanishing gradient, you can:
- initialize weights so that the potential for vanishing gradient is minimized;
- have Echo State Networks that are designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem;
- have Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs).

LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Networks
========================================
- Repeating module in a RNN contains a single layer
- Capable of learning long term dependencies
- steps in LSTM
 1. forget gate layer - decision to throw away not required information from cell state by a sigmoid layer
 2. input gate layer/memory gate - add new information to the cell gate. this layer contains sigmoid and tanh layers
 3. output layer - combine above 2 steps and send the output
    - sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we’re going to output
    - we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between −1 and 1) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.

LSTM with peepholes
======================
Cell state is also involved in each of the calculations


GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
===========================
