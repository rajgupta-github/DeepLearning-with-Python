About Pytorch
==============
- Python based scientific computing package
- Facebook Actively used
- Support for CUDA (DL Libarary of NVIDIA)
- Easy to use API
- Python Support
- Fast and feels native
- Pytorch is a cousin of lua based torch framework
- alternative to numpy

Concepts
==========
- Tensor: similar to numpy nd array running on GPU
- Variable: Node in computational graph, to store data and gradient

Comparison to Tensorflow
=========================
1. Dynamic Computational garph whereas in tensorflow static
2. can make use of standard python flow control
3. support for python debuggers
4. Dynamic inspection of variables and gradients
