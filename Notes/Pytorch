About Pytorch
==============
- Python based scientific computing package
- Facebook Actively used
- Support for CUDA (DL Libarary of NVIDIA)
- Easy to use API
- Python Support
- Fast and feels native
- Pytorch is a cousin of lua based torch framework
- alternative to numpy

Concepts
==========
- Tensor: similar to numpy nd array running on GPU
- Variable: Node in computational graph, to store data and gradient

Comparison to Tensorflow
=========================
1. Dynamic Computational garph whereas in tensorflow static
2. can make use of standard python flow control
3. support for python debuggers
4. Dynamic inspection of variables and gradients

Libraries for processing different type of data
===============================================
Image: OpenCV and Pillow
Audio: Scipy and Librosa
Text: Spacy and Cython
