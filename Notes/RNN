Types of Deep Learning
==========================
Supervised Deep Learning
 - ANN used for Regression and Classification
 - CNN used for Computer Vision
 - RNN used for Time Series Analysis
Usupervised Deep Learning
 - Self Organizing Maps used for Feature Detection
 - Deep Boltzmann Machines used for Recommnder Systems
 - Auto Encoders used for Recommnder Systems

Neural Networks and Human Brain
================================
Whole concept behind deep learning is to try to mimic the human brain and leverage the things that evolution has already developed for us.

Human Brain got 3 parts
- Cerebrum
    - Temporal Lobe (Long Term Memory) linked to ANN, Weights represent Long-term memory
    - Frontal Lobe - linked RNN for short term memory
    - Ocipital Lobe - linked to CNN
    - Parietal Lobe - Research going on for linking NN
- Cerebellum
- Brainstem

Types of RNN
=============
One to One
One to Many - Music Generation, Sentence generation from One Image
Many to One - Sentiment Analysis/Classification
Many to Many - (Input and Output are not same) Machine Translation
Many to Many - (Input and Output are same) Named Entity Recognition


People Behind Recurrent Neural Networks
========================================
Sepp (Joseph) Hochreiter - vanishing gradient was first discovered in 1991
Yoshua Bengio - vanishing gradient was again discovered in 1994


Solutions to the Vanishing Gradient Problem
=============================================
In case of exploding gradient, you can:
- stop backpropagating after a certain point, which is usually not optimal because not all of the weights get updated;
- penalize or artificially reduce gradient;
- put a maximum limit on a gradient.

In case of vanishing gradient, you can:

- initialize weights so that the potential for vanishing gradient is minimized;
- have Echo State Networks that are designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem;
- have Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs).
